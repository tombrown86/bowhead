UPDATE (1/26/2018): Vastly cleaned up the web configuration and verified it works with Postgres, and Timescale hypertables (http://timescale.com).

UPDATE (1/08/2018): PREVIEW of the official Docker container, with partial web configuration. Container is using Alpine Linux+Nginx+PHP7.1 with MariaDB and Redis. ... Still a work in progress, but, it will connect to coinigy -or- your ccxt accounts and pull ticker data into the database on the pairs you select in the web interface.

```
docker pull joeldg/bowhead

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 joeldg/bowhead
```
Then you will need to wait, it takes a while for it to fire up because of the composer update it needs to do.
When it comes up, it will be on port http://{IP}:8080/setup

via https://github.com/joeldg/bh_docker
Any feedback, good or bad, hit up the gitter link below.


1/06/2018 - MORE Major changes:
 Things are MORE THAN LIKELY BROKE because of the overhaul. I will need some Coinigy testers as I have built a web configuration for Bowhead where you select Coinigy (easy start) or CCXT and then the exchanges and select your trading pairs.
 
 HIT UP THE Gitter below and I will be posting info there.
 
 Also, working on an official Docker pull for this off DockerHub and a companion YouTube tutorial for setting it up in on both Mac and AWS (sorry windows folk). If you have sent me an email, I am sorry... I can answer 150 emails about Bowhead or I can get new features for Bowhead done, but not both. I am trying to go through the issues here and am going to clean them all out once the newer web interface is wrapped. (yes.. a web interface!!!!)

a REST-API and console-based cryptocurrency trading bot boilerplate and framework
Written by Joel De Gan, 2017


Bowhead (a type of whale) is the codename for a boilerplate within Laravel for building 
Cryptocurrency and Forex automated systems.

Utilizing a RESTful API, Bowhead can be used as a middle-layer for your favorite language
to interface with multiple brokerages and market makers, just add your API keys.

Bowhead utilizes all the TALib functions implemented in the Trader extenstion for PHP
and creates some of it's own indicators which are composites of those from TALib.

#### Focus of the project.
The primary focus is to have an easy to use boilerplate/framework that you can 
rapidly create a fully functional trading system on various strategies on 
BTC funded trading platforms that typically do not require that you are "verified"
this way you can trade with funds without funneling them through your bank and
having to deal with some potential tax issues (depending on the country you live in)

#### Companion article
This project has a companion article which walks you through how to set it up and walks you through 
setting up your first strategy and running it on [Whaleclub](https://whaleclub.co/join/tn6uE) 
and on [1Broker](https://1broker.com/?r=21434), which you will need accounts on both. 
Additionally the following are recommended exchnges:
* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=12325729)
* [Coinbase/GDAX](https://www.coinbase.com/join/51950ca286c21b84dd000021)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com)
* [CEX](https://cex.io/r/0/joeldg/0/)

Usage of [Coinigy](https://www.coinigy.com/?r=32d4c701)(free 1-month trial) also is being added.
 
The companion article is on Medum and is:

Part 3: [Let’s write a cryptocurrency bot (part 3)](https://medium.com/@joeldg/lets-write-a-cryptocurrency-bot-part-3-826d65e55184)

I highly suggest you read through it and follow along to get it up and running.

#### basic setup
You will need 
* PHP7.1
* Redis
* MySql 
* the PHP Pecl Trader extension, 

for Python
you will need the dotenv package. 
````
pip install python-env
````

#### Notes
This project was initially done in the Laravel-Lumen (lightweight) framework 
however the move to a fully open sourced boilerplate/framework I felt that having the 
full ability of Laravel could be important, particularly Jobs and other parts which
utilize queues could be invaluable.

Bowhead was written and tested on a Mac and I have it running in the cloud on an
Ubuntu linux server in AWS making real money trades every day on the Crypto
markets, on Forex pairs and on binary options.

One limitation that may mess up this running on Windows is the usage of a
named pipe for passing data between Python and PHP in real time, there are
ways around this, such as using Redis, or piping the output to a parser. 

I am open to suggestions for how to get it to work on Windows
 
#### A note about editors. 
> I would like to additionally say that when you are working with Laravel, it
 it is almost mandatory to use an editor like PHPStorm, you 'can' use something like
 Atom but it would be like trying to use notepad to work on a dotNet project,
 you can technically 'do it' but it will be frustrating and you will not have
 a good time.  I cannot recommend PHPStorm more highly. They have a free trial
 and with updates it extends the trial period, even still, if you choose to purchase
 it, it's not expensive.
 
#### additional libraries
 I have added a couple utility libs that I like to use with this.
 
 - Console class, this is for colorizing, doing progress bars and doing text tables in console which look like the following.
````
 ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
 ║ BTC    │                                      ║
 ║ LTC    │                                      ║
 ╚════════╧══════════════════════════════════════╝
````

If you feel in a tipping mood send BTC to
````

````

DONE:
1) Write my own Coinbase, Whaleclub, 1Broker wrappers.
2) Create Indicators wrapper for TALib.
3) Create Candles wrapper for TALib
4) Collect console functions into one Console class.
5) Streaming data from Oanda
6) Streaming data from Bitfinex
7) Dockerfile easy-setup done and tested.
8) Signals module
9) Strategies module
10) REST mapping module

IN PROGRESS:
1) REST-API 
2) Write my own Oanda, Bitfinex and Poloniex API wrappers.

TODO:
1) Standardize the calls to brokerages so the method names are the same across all of them.
2) reporting, logging and backtesting tools.
